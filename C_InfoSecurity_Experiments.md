### MD 5

MD 5 algorithm implementation.

MD5, whose full name is Message Digest Algorithm 5, is a hash function widely used in computer security to provide Message integrity protection. MD5 is an information summarization algorithm, which mainly converts text information into a short information summary through a specific hash hash method. The combination of compression + encryption +hash algorithm is absolutely irreversible. MD5 is an algorithm to input indefinite length information and output fixed length 128-bits. After the program flow, generate four 32-bit data, finally combined.



### DES

DES algorithm implementation. 

DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric key block Encryption algorithm for electronic Data Encryption. It takes 64 bits as the packet length, and the plaintext of a group of 64 bits as the input of the algorithm, and outputs the ciphertext of the same 64-bit length through a series of complex operations. DES also USES a 64-bit key, but because the last bit of every eight is used for parity, the actual effective key length is 56 bits. The key can be any number of 56 bits and can be changed at any time.



### X 509

X 509 folder provides the X 509 decode method using private key.

X.509 is the standard format for public key certificates in cryptography. X.509 certificates are used in many Intenet protocols including TLS/SSL. It is also used in many non-online applications, such as electronic signature services. X.509 certificates contain public keys, identity information, and signature information. For a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority or otherwise verifiable, the owner of the certificate can use the certificate and its corresponding private key to create secure communication and digitally sign the document.
